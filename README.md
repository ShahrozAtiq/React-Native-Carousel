## Discription

This React Native project aims to create a dynamic and engaging mobile application featuring three main components: an animated trapezoid-shaped carousel, an animated tab bar, and an animated emoji selector. The trapezoid carousel will offer a unique, modern aesthetic with smooth animations and responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices. The animated tab bar will enhance navigation with interactive animations, while the emoji selector will provide a fun and expressive way for users to communicate, complete with engaging animations and a wide selection of emojis. Developed from scratch, these components are designed to be easily integrated into your projects, providing a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that sets your app apart from traditional designs.
